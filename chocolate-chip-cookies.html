        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl beat shortening and butter with an electric
            mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add brown sugar,
            granulated sugar, and baking soda. Beat until mixture is combined,
            scraping sides of bowl occasionally.  Beat in eggs and vanilla
            until combined.  Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the
            mixer. Stir in any remaining flour.  Stir in chocolate pieces and,
            if desired, nuts.
        </li>

            Drop dough by rounded teaspoons 2 inches apart onto an ungreased
            cookie sheet. Bake in a 375 F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until
            edges are lightly browned.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
